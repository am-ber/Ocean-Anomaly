# Ocean Anomaly
This is a game that originally was supposed to be for the [GMTK Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024)
However, we were just two sick girls trying to make the game. With high fevers, and high dreams we couldn't finish the game in time for the dealine.
Hopefully that doesn't discourage us from making a really cool game.
## Core Concept
The core idea behind **Ocean Anomaly** is a really creative concept from a game called [Warning Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_Forever).
The concept primary concept used is that depending on how you kill the **Anomaly** and how it kills *you*, the **Anomaly** will adapt or evolve new body parts and new ways of attacking based on the previous way *you* killed the **Anomaly**.
